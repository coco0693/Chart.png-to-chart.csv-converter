# Chart.png-to-chart.csv-converter
The following script is able to convert a picture of a chart into a .csv file

In order to create useable data from pictures I've developed this small script that converts a visual data (.png file) into usable data (.csv files).

Note that for developing this script I've used as input data .png files downloaded from tradeville.eu stock evolution prices.
